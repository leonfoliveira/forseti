# Usage

This guide provides comprehensive instructions for using the Judge platform, covering both the command-line interface for contest administration and the web-based dashboard for different user roles.

## CLI

The Judge CLI tool (`./judge`) provides essential commands for Root administrators to manage the contest lifecycle. These commands enable quick contest operations directly from the command line.

### Contest Management

The CLI offers streamlined contest management operations for administrators. All commands require Root privileges to execute.

#### Creating a Contest

Create a new contest with a unique identifier:

```shell
./judge contest create <slug>
```

> **Note:** The `<slug>` must be unique and will be used in URLs and as the primary identifier for the contest.

#### Listing Contests

Display all contests in the system:

```shell
./judge contest ls
```

This command shows contest details including ID, slug, status, and timing information.

#### Starting a Contest

Force start a contest before its scheduled start time:

```shell
./judge contest start <contest-id>
```

> **Use Case:** Useful when you need to begin a contest immediately for testing or when schedules change unexpectedly.

#### Ending a Contest

Force end a contest before its scheduled end time:

```shell
./judge contest end <contest-id>
```

> **Warning:** This immediately terminates the contest. All submissions after this point will be rejected. Ensure all participants are notified before executing this command.

#### Deleting a Contest

Permanently delete a contest and all associated data:

```shell
./judge contest delete <contest-id>
```

> **Warning:** This action is irreversible and will remove all contest data, including submissions, clarifications, and announcements. Always create a backup before deleting a contest.

## Dashboard

The contest dashboard is the primary interface for all users during a contest, accessible at `https://judge.app`. The dashboard provides role-based views with different capabilities and access levels depending on the user's role: Root, Admin, Judge, Contestant, or Guest.

### Sign In

The authentication page where participants can sign in to access the contest. Users are automatically redirected to the appropriate dashboard based on their assigned role.

### Wait Page

A holding page that prevents non-administrative users (Judges, Contestants and Guests) from accessing the contest before its scheduled start time. This ensures fair competition by maintaining equal access timing for all participants.

## Contest Rules

Understanding the contest rules is essential for both participants and organizers to ensure fair competition and proper evaluation of submissions.

### Scoring and Ranking System

The platform uses a standard competitive programming ranking system based on the following criteria, applied in order:

**Primary Criteria:**

1. **Problems Solved**: Number of problems with accepted solutions
2. **Total Penalty Time**: Cumulative penalty calculated as:
   - 20 minutes added for each wrong submission before the first accepted solution
   - Plus the time elapsed (in seconds) from contest start to the accepted submission for each solved problem
3. **Acceptance Timestamps**: If tied on problems solved and penalty time, ranking is determined by the time of first acceptance, then second acceptance, and so on (measured in milliseconds for precision)
4. **Alphabetical Order**: As a final tiebreaker, participants are ordered alphabetically by name

**Important Rules:**

- Only the first accepted submission for each problem counts toward the final score
- Submissions made after a problem is already accepted do not affect penalty time or ranking
- Wrong submissions before acceptance add penalty time; wrong submissions after acceptance are ignored
- Time precision for penalty calculation is in seconds; tiebreakers use millisecond precision

> **Example:** If a contestant solves a problem at 45:30 (45 minutes, 30 seconds) after 2 wrong attempts, their penalty for that problem is: 45 minutes + 30 seconds + (2 Ã— 20 minutes) = 85 minutes and 30 seconds.
