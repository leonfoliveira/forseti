# Forseti Judge Platform

A comprehensive, production-ready platform for running secure and scalable competitive programming contests.

## Overview

Forseti Judge is a fullstack distributed system designed to manage competitive programming contests in secure, offline environments. With features for isolated code execution, real-time judging, leaderboards, and contest administration, it operates entirely without internet connectivity once deployed. Built with modern technologies and deployed using Docker Swarm, it provides a robust, self-contained solution for contests of any scaleâ€”from small educational events to large-scale competitions with hundreds of participants.

### Key Features

**ðŸ”’ Security First**

- Isolated execution environments using Docker sandboxes
- Code runs without internet access to prevent data exfiltration
- HTTPS encryption with self-signed TLS certificates
- Secure session-based authentication

**âš¡ Real-Time Experience**

- Live leaderboard updates via WebSocket
- Instant submission verdict notifications
- Real-time contest announcements and clarifications
- Automatic code execution and judging

**ðŸ“Š Contest Management**

- Comprehensive admin dashboard for contest configuration
- Support for multiple programming languages (C++, Java, Python)
- Flexible problem management with custom time/memory limits
- Role-based access control (Root, Admin, Judge, Contestant, Guest)

**ðŸš€ Scalable Architecture**

- Distributed microservices architecture
- Auto-scaling autojudge service based on submission queue depth
- Load balancing and rate limiting with Traefik
- Comprehensive monitoring with Prometheus, Loki, and Grafana

**ðŸŽ¯ Fair Competition**

- Standardized scoring and penalty system
- Configurable contest timing and rules
- Clarification system for participant questions
- Manual override capabilities for judges
